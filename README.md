# *Vice City* color scheme

## Description

The *Vice City* color scheme is optimized for light text on dark background using 80's style hi-viz colors. It is suitable for all kinds of programming and scripting languages as well as config files.

Currently available for various editors and in two different flavors.

The *Vim* scheme comes with transparent background, see `preview_vicecity.png` inside the `vim` sub-directory. However, transparency does **not** work in *GVim*.

## Supported editors

The following editors are supported (sorted alphabetically):

* *IDLE*
* *GNOME Editor* (also known as *gedit*)
* *GVim*
* *Spyder*
* *Vim*

## Flavors

There are two flavors of the color scheme:

* **Default**<br>By default the color for the comments is fuchsia. On one hand to make them clearly recognizable and on the other hand because it is a typical 80's hi-viz color.
* **Dark Gray**<br>Same as default, with dark gray comments instead.
