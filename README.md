## Description

The *Vice City* color scheme is optimized for light text on dark background using 80's style hi-viz colors. Intentionally designed for text-only environments, it is suitable for all kinds of programming and scripting languages as well as config files.

Currently available for various editors and in two different flavors.

The *Vim* scheme comes with transparent background, see `preview_vicecity.png` inside the `vim` sub-directory. However, transparency does **not** work in *GVim*.

## Flavors

There are two flavors of the color scheme:

*   **Default**<br>By default the color for the comments is fuchsia. On one hand to make them clearly recognizable and on the other hand because it is a typical 80's hi-viz color.
*   **Dark Gray**<br>Same as default, with dark gray comments instead.

## Pastel colors

### *Vim*

#### Graphical shell

Usually, terminal emulators (like *GNOME Terminal*) allow setting different color schemes. When using a scheme with pastel colors, the *Vim* color scheme will of course also appear in pastel instead of hi-viz colors.<img src="https://github.com/urbanware-org/vicecity/blob/master/vim/colors_pastel.png" alt="Pastel colors" align="right"/>

#### Non-graphical shell

In that environment only 16 colors can be used and none of them is a pastel color, so there is no way to use that type of colors.

### All others

For the other editors mentioned above there is no pastel version of the color scheme.
