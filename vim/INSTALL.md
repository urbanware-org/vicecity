# *Vice City* color scheme for *Vim*

The color scheme can be easily installed by adding the color scheme file to the corresponding color scheme directory.

How to install:

1. Download the preferred flavor of the color scheme or both of them.

1. Copy the file (or files) into the *Vim* color scheme directory, e. g. `/usr/share/vim/vim74/colors` depending on the installed version.

1. Start (or restart) *Vim* and type `:colorscheme` followed by a space and the name of the color scheme (for example `:colorscheme vicecity` for the default one or `:colorscheme vicecity_darkgray` for the one with dark gray comments) to enable the corresponding *Vice City* color scheme.

If you want to use a color scheme by default, edit the `.vimrc` file inside your home directory (e. g. `/home/johndoe/.vimrc`) and add a line with `colorscheme` (without a leading colon) followed by a space and the name of the preferred color scheme, as described above.
