# *Vice City* color scheme for *IDLE*

There are no separate color scheme files for *IDLE*, so you manually have to install or add the color scheme by modifying its highlight config file.

How to install:

1. First, close all running instances of *IDLE*.

1. Download the config file of the flavor you desire.

1. Navigate to your *IDLE* configuration directory, which usually is located inside the home directory of the current user, for example `/home/johndoe/.idlerc` on *Linux* systems and `C:\Users\John Doe\.idlerc` on *Windows*.

1. Check if the file `config-highlight.cfg` exists.

## File does not exist
   
In case it does not exist, rename the downloaded color scheme file by removing the name of the flavor (e. g. `config-highlight-default.cfg` to  `config-highlight.cfg`) and copy it into that directory.

Start *IDLE* and set the *Vice City* color scheme (custom theme) inside the preferences.

## File already exists

If it already exists, the *Vice City* color scheme can be added by editing the file.

Please backup the original config file `config-highlight.cfg` before proceeding to avoid possible problems caused by misconfiguration.

1. Edit the downloaded color scheme file.

1. Copy the whole content into the clipboard.

1. Edit the existing `config-highlight.cfg` file.

1. Paste the contents of the copied text on bottom of that file.

1. Start *IDLE* and set the *Vice City* color scheme (custom theme) inside the preferences.
